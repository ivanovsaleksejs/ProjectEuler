ProjectEuler
============

My solutions for Project Euler problems using Haskell.

Algorithms like fibonacci or primes are taken somewhere from the internet.

To launch test, just run, for example:
<pre>
runhaskell 011-020/011_product_grid.hs 
</pre>

Or you can use test script to launch several tests
<pre>
./test 2
</pre>
will launch all tests from 021-030 directory.
